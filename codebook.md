Variable Explanations
The column/variable names were tidied up/changed from their original state. What follows is a list of the changes made.
- Empty parentheses and hyphens removed
- "mean" capitalized to "Mean"
- "std" lengthened to "StandardDeviation"
- "Mag" lengthened to "Magnitude"
- t at the beginning of column/variable names lengthened to "Time"
- f at the beginning of column/variable names lengthened to "Frequency"
 
Additionally, variables containing "meanFreq" were retained, although they may not be explicit means of the actual accelerometer/gyroscope data. As explained by the readme from the .zip, meanFreq is the "Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency". I chose to include it within the data set as it technically is a mean of a measurement.
